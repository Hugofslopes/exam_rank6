<p>
This is the code I built for the Rank 6 exam. It creates a program that replicates the behavior of a <b>mini webserver</b>. I open sockets for each new client and then use <b>select</b> to manage all the fds. Each connected client receives a message when a new user joins or when another leaves. In addition, every message sent to the server is redistributed to all connected clients.
</p>
<p>
Using an infinite loop that contains an inner loop, the program iterates through each connected client and checks whether it's a new connection, has sent a message, or has disconnected.

<p>
It identifies a new client when the file descriptor (fd) is equal to the listening socket â€” the one created earlier.

<p>
If the fd is not ready for reading, the loop simply continues.

<p>
If the return value of recv is 0, it means the client has closed the connection gracefully.
If it's -1, an error occurred (e.g., connection reset, interrupted system call). In both cases, the function to remove the client is called.
